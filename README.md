## 📘 About

These C++ programs cover a wide range of topics including:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Data Structures (linked lists, trees, stacks, queues)
* Algorithms (sorting, searching, pattern generation)
* Standard Template Library (STL)
* Templates and Inheritance
* Expression conversions (like infix to postfix)
* High Performance Computing (HPC) concepts
* File handling and simulations (e.g., ticket booking systems)

Each code is written in a clear and modular style, with comments where needed for easier understanding.
